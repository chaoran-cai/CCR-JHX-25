The files are used for "arxiv links (to be added later)" and "article links (to be added later)".

File "DAER network2.cpp" was used for generating the network.

File "fig2.cpp" was used to generate the primary results, including Figures 2-6. However, when producing different figures, the parameters and associated statistical code require adjustment.

Before using File "fig2.cpp", please first use File "DAER network2.cpp" to create the required network.

The directive #include "big.c" incorporates a source file that implements random number generation functions. This file may be replaced by the user with an alternative implementation, assuming the necessary function signatures are preserved.
